    <h2> How block is utilised in my design</h2>

    <p>Normally , as block is used to delete some effects which  are critical to nuissance variables.I will use  randomization to reduce the contaminating effects of the remaining nuissance variables.Then, blocking will hep me to produce high significance in the variables of interest than randomizing.Additionally, block-level  can occupy the horizontal space of its parent element.</p>
