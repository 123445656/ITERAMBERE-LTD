  <h1> Soil erosion in rwanda.</h1>

</marquee>

<p>Rwanda has made different measures of avoiding soil erosion .Then,the country has restricted people to destroy the environment because it prevent soil erosion when they are a lot of trees.I have a reason to say this,when they are deforestation in some area , soil erosion can increase and can cause negaive effects to the farmers because some plants which can lost and go down to the lakes.
